TODO:
- Change sprite system to support sprite variants and multiple characters (not very difficult)
        - 3D sprite array?
- Add config file which can set many variable values and can be reloaded while the game is running
- Add partial sentence rendering so time-based text rendering can be done while the window is resized
- Add smooth glpyh fade-in
        - Add general animation system (using coroutines?) that this can be done with
- Fix chunky text rendering
        - Add fps indicator (for testing)
- Add menu display and functionality
- Fix save/load functions
        - Add menu for this
